This is a collection of projects I'm doing in college as a side, mainly inspired by Dr. Chris Bourke from UNL.
It's a sort of self imposed extracriccular I guess? Point being that I want to upload these for posterities sake. Once I've learned more, I can come back and look at these in the future to see where I came from.

For Anne.
